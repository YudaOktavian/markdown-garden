# Links

Links represent a connection between the current document and another resource.

In Markdown, links can be defined in three ways: inline links, reference
links, and automatic links.

- [Inline Links](inline-links)
- [Reference Links](reference-links)
- [Automatic Links](automatic-links)

Both inline links and reference links allow the writer to define link text to
be rendered on the page. For automatic links, the target resource's URI is
displayed on the page instead.
