# Automatic Links

Automatic links are defined in Markdown by surrounding the destination URL with
angle brackets. This will render the actual text of a URL and turn it into a
clickable/tappable link. For example:

```markdown
<http://www.commonmark.org>
```

Email addresses can also be turned into clickable/tappable links that will be
by placing them in angle brackets:

```markdown
<someone@example.com>
```
