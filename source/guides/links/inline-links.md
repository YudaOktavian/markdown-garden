# Inline Links

Inline links are defined in Markdown by placing the link text in square
brackets followed by the URL of the link destination in regular brackets. For
example:

```markdown
[CommonMark website](http://www.commonmark.org)
```

An optional link title may be added after the destination URL, separated by a
space and surrounded by double quotes:

```markdown
[CommonMark website](http://www.commonmark.org "CommonMark")
```

If the destination URL is on the same server, you may use relative URLs, for
example:

```markdown
[Spec page](/spec)
```
