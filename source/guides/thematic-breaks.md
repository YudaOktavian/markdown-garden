# Thematic Breaks

Thematic breaks are breaks between two themes, usually placed between two paragraphs.

Thematic breaks should be used to represent scene changes or transition the reader to another topic within the same section.

In Markdown documents, thematic breaks may be represented by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a separate line. For example:

```markdown
A paragraph before the thematic break.
---
A paragraph after the thematic break.
```

```markdown
A paragraph before the thematic break.
***
A paragraph after the thematic break.
```

```markdown
A paragraph before the thematic break.
___
A paragraph after the thematic break.
```

Spaces may be placed between the hyphens, asterisks, or underscores. For example:

```markdown
A paragraph before the thematic break.
* * *
A paragraph after the thematic break.
```

By default, many applications and websites present thematic breaks as a horizontal rule.
