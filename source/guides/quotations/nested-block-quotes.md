# Nested Block Quotes

Block quotes can be nested inside of other block quotes. This can be done by
adding additional levels of greater-than signs. For example:

```markdown
> This is a block quote containing another block quote.
>
> > This is the block quote within a block quote.
>
> This text is part of the outer block quote.
```

Nested block quotes may also contain other Markdown elements nested inside of
them, for example headers and lists:

```markdown
> This is a block quote containing another block
> quote which contains a header and a list.
>
> > # This is a header
> >
> > 1. Item One
> > 2. Item Two
```
