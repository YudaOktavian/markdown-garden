# Quotations

Quotations represent text (or other content) that has been quoted from another
source.

Inline quotations are defined by placing text inside double quote marks,
as you might find in a plain text document. For example: `"This sentence is
quoted."` Markdown does not contain any special syntax for inline quotations.

Block quotations may be used for quotations that cover one or more lines.

Block quotes may also contain other block quotes nested inside of the outer
block quote. These are called nested block quotes.
