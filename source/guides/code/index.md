# Code

Code spans and blocks represent fragments of programming or markup source code.

Inline code spans may be used for spans of code within a normal paragraph.

Code blocks are special areas of the document reserved for programming code
or markup that is not formatted into paragraphs and each line is rendered as a
separate line. Code blocks are defined in two ways: indented code blocks and
fenced code blocks.
