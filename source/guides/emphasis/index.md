# Emphasis

Emphasis represented text that should be emphasised to the reader. Emphasis comes in two types: stress emphasis and strong importance.

- [Strong Importance](/guides/emphasis/strong-importance)

Although emphasis is commonly rendered as italics and bold, emphasis in Markdown should not be thought of as necessarily italics or bold. Some applications may render emphasis differently, for example by underlining the emphasised text.
