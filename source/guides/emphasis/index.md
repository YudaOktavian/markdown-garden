# Emphasis

Emphasis represented text that should be emphasised to the reader. Emphasis
comes in two types: stress emphasis and strong importance.

- [Stress Emphasis](stress-emphasis)
- [Strong Importance](strong-importance)

Although emphasis is commonly rendered as italics and bold, emphasis in
Markdown should not be thought of as necessarily italics or bold. Some
applications may render emphasis differently, for example by underlining the
emphasised text.
