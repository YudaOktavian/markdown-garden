# Line Breaks

A line break represents the end of a line and the beginning of a new line.

Line breaks should only be used to represent breaks that are part of the
meaning of the content, as in poems or addresses, rather than purely visual
breaks in the text, as in [paragraphs](../paragraphs).

A line break has be added to a Markdown document by adding two spaces to the
end of a line. For example:

```ruby
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  
Nullam eget eros in nulla dignissim suscipit.
```

CommonMark compliant applications also allow line breaks to be defined with a
backslash at the end of a line. For example:

```ruby
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\
Nullam eget eros in nulla dignissim suscipit.
```
