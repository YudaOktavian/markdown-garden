# Inline Images

Inline images are defined in Markdown by preceding the markup with an
exclamation mark followed by the image's alternative text in square brackets
followed by the URL of the image in regular brackets. For example:

```markdown
![CommonMark logo](http://www.commonmark.org/logo.png)
```

An optional image title may be added after the URL, separated by a space and
surrounded by double quotes:

```markdown
![CommonMark logo](http://www.commonmark.org/logo.png "CommonMark logo")
```

If the destination URL is on the same server, you may use relative URLs like
this:

```markdown
![CommonMark logo](/logo.png)
```
