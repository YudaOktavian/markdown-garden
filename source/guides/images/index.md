# Images

Images are pictures that are intended to be embedded in the current document,
from either the same server or from an external image provider.

In Markdown, images can be defined in two ways: inline images and reference
images.

- [Inline Images](inline-images)
- [Reference Images](reference-images)

Both inline links and reference links allow the writer to define alternative
text to be rendered on the page if the image is unavailable or to web browsers
and screen readers which cannot display images.
