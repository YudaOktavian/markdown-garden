# Headers

Headers represent the heading of a section of the document.

Headers should not be used to represent subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles or taglines unless these are intended represent the heading of a new section or subsection of the document.

In Markdown, headers can be defined in two ways: Setext headers and ATX headers.

- [Setext Headers](/guides/headers/setext-headers)
- [ATX Headers](/guides/headers/atx-headers)

Both header types represent the semantic meaning of the header in the same way, although Atx headers allow the writer to define additional heading levels.
