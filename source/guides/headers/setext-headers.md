# Setext Headers

Setext Headers are defined in Markdown by underlining heading text, with either an equals sign or with hyphens, depending on the strength of the header.

Place equals signs on the line below the heading text to turn it into a first level header. For example:

```markdown
This is a first level heading
=============================
```

Place hyphens on the line below the heading text to turn it into a second level header. For example:

```markdown
This is a second level heading
------------------------------
```

It is not possible to define, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth level headers using Setext headers. Instead, use [Atx Headers](/guides/headers/atx-headers).
