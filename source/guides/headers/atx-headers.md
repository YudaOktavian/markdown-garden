# ATX Headers

ATX Headers are defined in Markdown by placing hash signs followed by a space
before the heading text. The number of hash signs depends on the strength of
the header. The hash sign must be placed on a new line.

ATX Headers can be used to define headers up to six levels deep. Examples:

```markdown
# This is a first level header
```

```markdown
## This is a second level header
```

```markdown
### This is a third level header
```

```markdown
#### This is a fourth level header
```

```markdown
##### This is a fifth level header
```

```markdown
###### This is a sixth level header
```

One or more optional closing hash signs may be placed at the end of the header
for cosmetic purposes:

```markdown
## This is a second level header ##
```

The number of hash signs at the end of the header does not matter. For example
you could end a second level header with three hash signs, like this:

```markdown
## This is a second level header ###
```
