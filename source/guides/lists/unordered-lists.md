# Unordered Lists

Unordered lists represent lists of items, where the order of the items is
unimportant. If an unordered list is reordered, the semantic meaning of the
document would not change.

In Markdown, an unordered list is defined by placing an asterisk, plus sign, or
hyphen, followed by a space, at the start of each list item. For example:

```markdown
* Metaphysics
* Epistemology
* Ethics
```

```markdown
+ Metaphysics
+ Epistemology
+ Ethics
```

```markdown
+ Metaphysics
+ Epistemology
+ Ethics
```

A new unordered list can be started by changing the list marker:

```markdown
* Item in first list
* Another item in first list
- Item in second list
- Another item in second list
```
