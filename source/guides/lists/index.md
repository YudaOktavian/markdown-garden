# Lists

Lists represent structured lists of items. Lists come in two types: unordered
lists and ordered lists.

- [Unordered Lists](unordered-lists)
- [Ordered Lists](ordered-lists)

Both types of lists can also contain sublists nested within the list. These are
called nested lists.

- [Nested Lists](nested-lists)
