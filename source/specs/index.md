# Specs

## Specifications of "Core" Markdown Features

[Daring Fireball: Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - the
original specification of Markdown by John Gruber.

[CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org) - a strongly defined, highly compatible
specification of Markdown.

## Extensions to CommonMark

[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) - a superset of the
CommonMark spec containing extensions for tables, task list items,
strikethrough, autolinks, and disallowed raw HTML.

[Markdown Content Blocks](https://github.com/iainc/Markdown-Content-Blocks) -
adds support for file transclusion (images, text files, and CSV tables) with
captions.

## Other Markdown Flavours (Non-CommonMark)

[Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) - an 
extension to PHP Markdown that implements some features that are not available 
with the regular Markdown syntax.

[MultiMarkdown](http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/syntax.html) - a 
superset of Markdown, adding support for a large number of Markdown extensions 
and output formats besides HTML.

[Pandoc's Markdown](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) - another superset of
Markdown from the author of CommonMark, adding support for many new features 
and designed for multiple output formats.

[GitLab Flavored Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) -
similar to GitHub Flavoured Markdown, but adding support for a number of new
features such as video, Mermaid diagrams, and GitLab-specific references.

## Similar Languages

[Markua](https://leanpub.com/markua/read) - called "Markdown for books", Markua
is the successor to [Leanpub Flavored Markdown](https://leanpub.com/syntax) 
that maps some Markdown syntax to book concepts, while adding new syntax and 
concepts.
